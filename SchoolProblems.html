                                      <h1>School Problems</h1>
        
        <p>So here we will be talking about things that bother most people in school and how to handle them!</p>
  
   
   
   
   <h4>HOW TO HANDLE STRESS</h4>
  Lately I've been learning about STRESS. People are counting on you,</br> You need things done when you don't have the time and you just need ways to relax. This is called STRESS. </br>Stress is also known as pressure, it can be caused at times when you need to get something done or in arguements.     
   
   
   
   
   <h4>Being excluded from a group/ friends</h4>
           
           <p>If you have been excluded these might help </br>
              1.Ask if you can join if not walk away</br>
              2.Ask someone else if you can play/talk with them</br>
              3.Play with your self </br>
              Sorry if I am not good at this I am not really the best writer/advice giver</br>

 <h4><b>HOMEWORK</b></h4>
 <p>First of all the one that we dislike the most HOMEWORK.</p>
        All our teachers always have given us time to work on our homework so thats helpful. To help you study easier here is our top six personal studying tips!
        1.Have a clean and organized environment to study in.<br />
        2.Don't be distracted like listening to music unless they       
          help you focus more.<br />
        3.Don't work on everything at once, start only one a time    
         ,it will help you focus more. <br />
        4.Do not eat or drink too much otherwise you'll find 
          yourself going to the washroom very often.<br />
        5.When studying takes breaks once in a while because YOU   
          NEED REST.<br />
        6.Try every once in a while to go over it and memorize little by little.<br />

         <H4><b>FIGHTS
         </b></H4> 
          <p>When your in a fight with your best frind here are some steps you'll want to fallow if you want to become friends again.</p>
          
  
   
   1.Don't do anything to make the situation worse. (Such as making rude faces, giving mean notes,etc)<br />
   2.Once you both  cooled down  then give them a call or talk face to face. Avoiding eachother won't make things better.<br />
   3.Slowly interact. Work on a project together or hang out around eachother. <br />
   
   <p>If you fallow these steps, i'm sure your friendsship will improve from the fight.
